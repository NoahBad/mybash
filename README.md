# mybash
## My bash prompt customizations!

This is primarily a set of visual customizations I'm making to my bash prompt.
It's designed to be a customizable set of "banners" that contain a hostname,
the current directory, and git status. Colors are easily changable but making
multiple different configs makes switching easier and equally speeds up tweaks
on a new system. The goal here was to create a pretty bash prompt without need
for special programs like OhMyBash or Starship. To use, simply take one of 
these files, rename to ".bashrc" and move to your home directory! More info on
theming included in the files.
