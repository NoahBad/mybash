## My bash prompt customizations!

This is primarily a set of visual customizations I'm making to my bash prompt.
It's designed to be a customizable set of "banners" that contain a hostname,
the current directory, and git status. Colors are easily changable but making
multiple different configs makes switching easier and equally speeds up tweaks
on a new system. 

The goal here was to create a pretty bash prompt primarily without need for 
special programs. To use, simply take one of these files, rename to ".bashrc" 
and move to your home directory! More info on theming included in the files. 
Currently the Nord theme is the only config that requires the addition of 
Starship and, coincidentally, is the only one that has all my custom aliases.
For them to work right, install zoxide, fzf, bat, and eza.
